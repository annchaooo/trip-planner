# Project Brief: WanderNote

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Status:** Approved for PRD Development

---

## Executive Summary

**WanderNote** is a mobile trip planning application designed for solo travelers, couples, and small friend groups (2-4 people) who want to create meaningful, themed travel experiences to cities and villages. Unlike generic trip planners that focus purely on logistics, WanderNote combines practical planning tools with rich journey documentation capabilities, allowing travelers to capture their adventures through essays, photos, drawings, and voice memos while maintaining budget control.

The app addresses the gap between sterile itinerary planners and retrospective journaling apps by integrating planning, navigation, documentation, and budget tracking into a unified experience. WanderNote empowers travelers to define trip purposes (adventure, culture, food, relaxation) and build their stories as they travel, creating both a planning tool and a living travel memoir.

**Primary value proposition:** Plan with purpose, travel with clarity, document with creativity—all in one free mobile app.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

**Fragmented Travel Tools:** Travelers currently juggle multiple disconnected apps:
- Trip planning apps (TripIt, Google Trips) - logistics only, no storytelling
- Map/navigation apps (Google Maps) - navigation only, no context
- Budget tracking apps (Splitwise, TravelSpend) - expenses only, no planning
- Journaling apps (Day One, Journey) - retrospective only, no real-time integration
- Photo apps (Instagram, Photos) - social-first, not private travel documentation

**Result:** Constant app-switching, data scattered across platforms, no unified travel narrative, friction in documenting experiences.

**Inadequate Group Coordination:** Small groups (2-4 friends) struggle to:
- Coordinate plans without overwhelming group chat noise
- Split expenses fairly without manual spreadsheets or separate apps
- Share trip documentation privately without social media pressure
- Maintain focus on trip theme/purpose amidst planning chaos

**Lost Travel Stories:** Travelers intend to document their journeys but:
- Postpone journaling until after the trip (then forget details)
- Take hundreds of photos but never organize or annotate them
- Lose authentic in-the-moment reflections and emotions
- End with fragmented memories instead of cohesive travel stories

**Impact:**
- 73% of travelers report feeling overwhelmed by trip planning complexity (research needed)
- Average traveler uses 4-6 different apps for a single trip
- Most trip photos remain unorganized and undocumented
- Small groups report frustration with expense splitting and coordination

### Why Now?

- **Post-pandemic travel surge:** Pent-up demand for meaningful travel experiences
- **Digital fatigue:** Users seeking private, intimate documentation vs. social media performance
- **Mobile-first lifestyle:** Travelers expect complete functionality on smartphones
- **Generational shift:** Millennials/Gen Z value experiences + storytelling over possessions

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

WanderNote is an **all-in-one mobile travel companion** that unifies four essential travel needs:

1. **Purposeful Planning** - Define trip themes and create intentional itineraries
2. **Integrated Navigation** - Map reference for exploring cities/villages
3. **Creative Documentation** - Rich multimedia journaling (text, photos, drawings, voice)
4. **Smart Budget Tracking** - Expense tracking with group splitting

### Key Differentiators

**vs. Generic Trip Planners (TripIt, Google Trips):**
- ✅ Rich creative documentation (not just logistics)
- ✅ Theme-driven planning (purpose-first approach)
- ✅ Private, intimate focus (not social/public)

**vs. Journaling Apps (Day One, Journey):**
- ✅ Real-time documentation during travel (not retrospective)
- ✅ Integrated planning and budget tracking (not journal-only)
- ✅ Group coordination features (not solo-only)

**vs. Budget Apps (Splitwise, TravelSpend):**
- ✅ Full trip planning context (not just expenses)
- ✅ Map and documentation integration (not spreadsheet-only)

**vs. Notion/Coda Templates:**
- ✅ Zero setup required (not DIY assembly)
- ✅ Mobile-optimized (not desktop-first)
- ✅ Purpose-built for travel (not generic workspace)

### Why This Will Succeed

- **Clear target audience:** Solo travelers, couples, small groups with specific needs
- **Genuine pain point:** Tool fragmentation is real and frustrating
- **Emotional connection:** Helps create and preserve meaningful travel memories
- **Free model:** No paywall friction for core features
- **Mobile-first:** Built for the device travelers actually use
- **Private by default:** Appeals to users tired of social media performance
